# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis Using Python

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Netflix titles using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**. It explores trends in content type, release years, duration patterns, and country-wise production, applying essential data cleaning and visualization techniques.

## 🔍 Objective

To understand the distribution and evolution of Netflix's content over time by:
- Cleaning and structuring the dataset for analysis
- Visualizing trends in Movies vs TV Shows
- Analyzing movie durations and release patterns
- Gaining insights into content origin (countries)

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Format: CSV
- Source: Netflix Titles Dataset  
- Key Columns: `type`, `title`, `release_year`, `duration`, `country`, `rating`, `listed_in`, `director`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- VS Code (IDE)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

- 🎥 Movie vs TV Show distribution over the years
- ⏱️ Histogram of movie durations (in minutes)
- 🌎 Content origin analysis (top countries)
- 🔢 Handling mixed-format durations (`min` vs `Season`)
- 🧹 Missing value treatment using `dropna` and filtering
